# Aging-Populations
This is an interactive web map that depicts the world's top 50 aging populations. The Map is based on a 2023 article by the BBC titled “Japan Population: One in 10 people now aged 80 or older” The data from this map is from the Population Reference Bureau that was turned into a .csv file and joined with a world administrative boundary shapefile that was then turned into a .geojson file. 

The data is displayed as a choropleth map using green and blue hues on a leaflet provider map. The header is centered at the top of the map. To the left of the map, there is a section box that describes what the map is depicting as well as a link to the BBC article. When the mouse is hovering over the box the opacity changes from .4 to 1 in order to see the information clearly. At the bottom right of the screen, the legend is shown that corresponds with the data and shading of the map. 

Each country on the map has a popup feature that provides information on the country's name, its ranking, the percentage of older people, and an image of each country's population pyramid. When a country is clicked on, a zoom-in action occurs. When the zoomed-in country is clicked, the map zooms out to its original scale.
